# RAG_With_DeepSeek_R1

In this project, we're going to use the chineese `LLM` called `DeepSeek_R1` and `Ollama` to build a Retrival Augmented Generation (`RAG`). Indeed, that RAG will be running locally on our computer. So, no need to be necessary online before using our Generative AI.
For designing the frontend of the application, we will use `Streamlit`. For future work, we might use `Flask` or `FastApi`.
